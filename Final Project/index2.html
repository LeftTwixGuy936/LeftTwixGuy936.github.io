			<h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
			<p>   OceanFish Inc was founded in September of 2018 by Tim Oceanfish and Javnot Bal.  At first the company was a non-profit endeaver that aided the local FRC team, the RoboWarriors.  A simple drivetrain project was the kickstart that OceanFish Inc needed to get off the gorund.  With such resounding success in this area OceanFish Inc has expanded into a school-wide leader in mechanical and electrical design research and developement.  Having grown in size and funding due to excellent business partners, like Haas Automation and The Cheesy Poofs, OceanFish Inc is now capable of providing products and services to the general public.  Over the course of many design projects, the company has developed a set of tips and tricks to speed through the design process expending less time and wasting less resources.  OceanFish Inc is now selling build it yourself kits and preassembled versions of all our projects.  Along with our own products, OceanFish Inc has become a distributor of West Coast Product, Vex and, Andymark products.  It is a great honor that Fujikawa-Hagiwara Ltd acquired OceanFish Inc last February.  Now a small company as the resources of a multibillion imaginary dollar company.</p>
			<h2>The Team</h2>
			<p>Since September of 2019, OceanFish Inc has grown from a two man operation to a company that employs over ten people.  Same-Here Howe (CTO) is responsible for keeping the company on par with the rest of the world, technologically speaking.  Day to day operations and making sure OceanFish Inc delivers on its promises is the responsibility of Kyle Schling (COO).  Since the last CNC Technician retired, Chris Travota has taken over the responsibilities of this incredible machine.  Fortunately before the acquisition of OceanFish Inc by Fujikawa-Hagiwara Ltd, the one and only Matt Almond-Tree was brought on to manage budgets and lead cost saving efforts.  Dot Lee and Kebab Elamurugan were hired only recently to help with public relations and IT because mechanical engineers are not to good at these things.</p>
			<h3>Our Sister Companies</h3>
			<p>  Fujikawa-Hagiwara Ltd is a world leader in everything from artitecture to zoology, and, since its founding in 1997, has taken on dozens of local and national companies.  Some the most notable sister companies of OceanFish Inc are KJV Metals and the Banana Co.  KJV Metals was founded in 2000 by Jim Kepley, Frank Jones, and Robert Volkman.  OceanFish Inc uses KJV for all our metal needs.  The stock used in all OceanFish Inc products is provided by KJV and the KJV metal factory allows OceanFish Inc to melt down, extrude and reuse all waste metal stock.  Back in 2015, Matt Almond-Tree and Tim Oceanfish founded the Banana Company on the principles of simplicity and unorthodoxy.  Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump gave tremendously positive reviews of the Banana Company's first products, the E-Lamp and E-Ball.  It too had been acquired by Fujikawa-Hagiwara Ltd but in  early 2017, before the founding of OceanFish Inc.  Due to legal complications in late 2017, both Matt Amond-Tree and Tim Oceanfish were forced out of the Banana Company.  Despite these unfortunate circumstances, OceanFish Inc is still proud to work along side all of the Fujikawa-Hagiwara companies.</p>
